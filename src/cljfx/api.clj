  "Main API namespace for cljfx

  Requiring this namespace starts JavaFX runtime if it wasn't previously started

  Sections:
  - JavaFX-specific helpers and info:
    - [[initialized]] - keyword indicating whether JavaFX was initialized by cljfx or not
    - [[on-fx-thread]] - run code on fx thread
    - [[run-later]] - run code asynchronously on fx thread
  - low-level component interaction:
    - [[create-component]] - creates component from description
    - [[advance-component]] - changes previously created component to new description
    - [[delete-component]] - deletes previously created/advanced component
    - [[instance]] - get JavaFX object from component
  - extension lifecycles:
    - [[ext-instance-factory]] - manually create component instance
    - [[ext-on-instance-lifecycle]] - observe created/advanced/deleted instances
    - [[ext-let-refs]] - manage component lifecycles decoupled from component tree
    - [[ext-get-ref]] - use offscreen component instance introduced by [[ext-let-refs]],
      possibly in multiple places
    - [[ext-set-env]] - put values into environment
    - [[ext-get-env]] - get values from environment
    - [[ext-many]] - manage a vector of components
    - [[make-ext-with-props]] - create lifecycle that uses user-defined props
  - automatic component lifecycle:
    - [[keyword->lifecycle]] - component/renderer `:fx.opt/type->lifecycle` opt function
      that returns lifecycle of keyword fx-types
    - [[fn->lifecycle]] - component/renderer `:fx.opt/type->lifecycle` opt function that
      returns lifecycle of function fx-types
    - [[fn->lifecycle-with-context]] - renderer `:fx.opt/type->lifecycle` opt function
      that returns lifecycle of function fx-types that also receive context as argument.
      Used in conjunction with [[wrap-context-desc]]
    - [[wrap-map-desc]] - renderer middleware that changes received description
    - [[wrap-many]] - renderer middleware that allows multiple root descriptions instead
      of one

      and passes down the description tree, used with [[fn->lifecycle-with-context]]
    - [[create-renderer]] - create function that automatically handles component lifecycle
    - [[mount-renderer]] - watch `*ref` for updates and re-render component
    - [[unmount-renderer]] - stop watching `*ref` for updates and tear down component

      it
    - [[sub]] - extract value from a context and memoize it using key or function
    - [[swap-context]] - create new context using function that reuses existing cache
    - [[reset-context]] - derive new context that reuses existing cache
    - [[unbind-context]] - debug utility that releases context from dependency tracking

    - [[wrap-co-effects]] - wrap event handler to replace input side effects (such as
      derefing app state) with pure functions
    - [[make-deref-co-effect]] - helper function that creates deref co-effect
    - [[wrap-effects]] - wrap event handler to replace output side effects (such as
      updating app state, performing http requests etc.) with pure functions
    - [[make-reset-effect]] - helper function that creates effect that resets atom
    - [[dispatch-effect]] - effect that allows dispatching another events
    - [[wrap-async]] - wrap event handler to perform event processing in background
  - combining it all together:
    - [[create-app]] - convenient function that combines all cljfx concepts to create
      applications with pure views, subscriptions and event handlers"
